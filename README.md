===============

Pixilang is a pixel-oriented programming language for small graphics/sound applications and experiments. Originally created by Alexander Zolotov (NightRadio) and Mik Razuvaev (Goglus) for non-programmers, demosceners and designers. It is cross-platform and open source (MIT License). 

Pixilang programs are stored in text files (UTF8) with extensions .txt or .pixi. So you can use your favorite text editor to create/edit these files. Pixilang has no built-in editor.
